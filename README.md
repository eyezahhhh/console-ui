# Console UI

I have a Dell OptiPlex 980 sitting under my TV acting as a console that streams games from my PC using [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org). Since this workload is pretty light I figured I could go the easy route and create a beautiful, custom UI for the big screen using Electron.

This UI is optimized for use with game controllers and my Nintendo Switch Lite. My goal is for it to also support controlling basic system features like WiFi and display brightness.
